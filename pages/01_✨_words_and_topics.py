**I [generated a wordcloud](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/index.html) and conducted topic 
modeling with the lyrics I had scraped. To achieve better performance, I processed the lyrics 
beforehand. I first diced the lyrics into words, picked out all the nouns, and lemmatized these 
nouns with [Stanza](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/stanza). Then I eliminated all the 
[curse words](https://github.com/LDNOOBW/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words). 
Finally, I counted the frequencies of all the remaining words and excluded those words of which 
the frequency z-scores were not between -3 and 3 (indicating these words occurred too few/many times).**
"""

text12 = """
**Please activate the toggle below to check the wordcloud of the 2020s pop songs' lyrics. 
Words with larger size occur more times in my sample. The shape and color of this wordcloud 
come from an [earth photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Earth_Western_Hemisphere_transparent_background.png).**
"""

text13 = """
**I detected the topics of 2020s pop music with the 
[LDA model from Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html). 
To settle on a proper number of topics, I tried values from 2 to 10, and the coherence score 
hit the highest when the number of topics was 10. For each topic, the corresponding words were 
sorted by their possibilities of occurrence in descending order, 
and I kept the top 20 words for each topic.**

**I sought help from [OpenAI](https://itsc.hkust.edu.hk/services/it-infrastructure/azure-openai-api-service) 
to interpret these 10 lists of words. You can activate the toggle below to check the model and prompt I used.**
"""

**Please check the 20 words for each of the 10 topics as well as the interpretations 
generated by LLM with the selectbox below. You may notice that some of the words are 
just nonsense, such as 't' in Topic 1 and 'ba' in Topic 4, which can result from the 
lemmatization and calls for further optimization.**
